GameText+ is an include for both SA-MP and open.mp that improves the native GameText. 

It introduces enhanced styling options, improved functionality, and seamless integration with existing scripts.

## Key Features

- Drop-in replacement for native GameText functions
- Fader functionality integrated
- Full SA-MP and open.mp compatibility

## Installation

1. Download the latest version of `gametext_plus.inc`
2. Place the file in your project's includes directory
3. Add the following line to your script:

```pawn
#include <gametext_plus>
```
4. OPTIONAL: If you want the include to override the native GameText (Style 1 -> 6), add the following line:
```pawn
#define OVERRIDE_NATIVE_GAMETEXT // This line should be added before including GameText+!
#include <gametext_plus>
```

## Compatibility

- **SA-MP**: Fully compatible
- **open.mp**: Fully compatible
- **fixes.inc**: Replaces fixes.inc, it's incompatible and needs to be removed.

## Usage Examples

GameText+ seamlessly replaces native functions while providing enhanced functionality, this means no code changes are needed!
Some examples:

```pawn
// Show GameText to all players using location style
GameTextForAll("Grove Street", 5000, 8);

// Show money earned with positive money style
GameTextForPlayer(playerid, "+$50,000", 3000, 11);

// Display radio station with radio style
GameTextForPlayer(playerid, "K-Rose", 3000, 9);

```
